Hello Dear Reader!

I saw my sister and her family yesterday! It's like my soul has been recharged! My niece and nephew are the **best!**

I'm going to have to give Dawa some more love here in a minute, just wanted to check in and say I actually got the courage (and agency in authorship, lol) to post on r/programmingbuddies! And I made it through therapy today! Holy moley, heavy. Going _through_ it here, lol.

Okay, if I don't get back and maybe do some styling work, etc, love you!
