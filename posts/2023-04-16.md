Yay, finished the `newPost` function! It's a good morning!

It was kind of a crappy night. Florida has passed in sequence: the death penality for sexual abuse of a minor, codified being trans or in drag as sexual abuse of a minor, and the death penalty only needing a 8 to 4 vote rather than being unanimous. Excuse me while I'm radicalized a little, here, lol!

I've got to get the place together and ready for this week, good luck and God's speed, friends.
