## Dev Diary

Ooo, domain down! Apparently domains with Google domains, if you let them expire for like a few months, it's way more money to get them back, and that's not happening, so ... looks like new url time! findingintegrity.dev it is!

Hmm. It's time to head out, I took Dawa for a bike ride, got back, had breakfast, and Olga asked if I could pick something up for her and it's about that time. I'm using something like the Cornell method setting this server up, so it's taking a bit, hopefully I can pick back up and maintain momentum though.
