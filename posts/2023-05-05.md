## Aaand We're Live!

A-live, at least! The only thing on the actual internet is an under construction page, it's there though, and I need to go to Chez Marshalles and get some jeans and ShopRite for some beans and onions and things. Phew. I feel, like ... to be on the internet, in some little corner, is to be really connected to the global culture. Not being able to make posts on Reddit because I never comment and don't have karma, I was like, oh, my goodness, so alone.

Okay, size 11, says the Internet. Wish me luck, Dear Reader!
