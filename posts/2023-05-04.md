## Oof!

Good morning, Dear Reader!

My body is good and messed up this morning! Still functional, knock on wood, my legs though, eep! Bonnie is a little older and not as crazy anymore, Jagger is a handful, though, and yesterday I forgot my wallet when getting my bike, so that was an extra hour of biking, and I wasn't really sure that Sue was going to need me in the afternoon but lo and behold this is going to be like a thing, and I said my name was Integrity! I forgot to mention the NB part again and got a he corrected to she, which I'll take, I think I'm going to write it on a card and give it with cookies, though, I'm so embarassed to have that conversation, like 99% of the time, because like 1% of the time people understand and are like yes, and what are your pronouns, and it's like, oh I can breathe around you, okay.
